Environmental protection is undoubtedly a high-profile topic in the world today, and forest conservation is an important aspect of this. As the United Nations expects, humanity is working to help forests recover and achieve sustainable management of forests to address and mitigate climate change and the biodiversity crisis. In particular, data science can be a tool for studying the conservation of forest vegetation in order to accelerate the use of information and the efficiency of forest conservation efforts. Therefore, classifying and modelling forest cover types through data such as soil type, slope and altitude can help researchers to efficiently discern forest types for good use and sustainable development of forest resources.
